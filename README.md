# RedisDistro

**RedisDistro** is a fast, reliable Redis‑based **email queue** for Node.js applications, implemented in **TypeScript**. It allows subscription to be enqueued and processed asynchronously, decoupling email sending from your API logic and improving responsiveness and scalability.

---

## Features

- **Express + TypeScript stack**: Clean, typed, modern architecture.
- **Redis queue via `ioredis`**: Fast, reliable, in-memory queueing for job tasks.
- **Environment-driven config** using `dotenv`.
- **Email processing**: Likely integrates with SMTP or email services for delivery (inferred from architecture).
- **Async job processing**: API quickly returns after enqueuing, while workers handle the heavy lifting.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Redis** instance running (local or remote)
- **SMTP provider** (for sending actual emails)
- **.env file** with relevant configuration (e.g., `REDIS_URL`, `SMTP_HOST`, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saloni1707/RedisDistro.git
cd RedisDistro
npm install
```

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (output in `dist/`)
npm run start     # Run compiled app (node dist/index.js)
npm run dev       # Run TypeScript in watch mode for development
```

## Usage Overview

1. **Client** sends a subscription request (e.g., via POST `/subscribe` with email).
2. **API layer** records the subscription (e.g., in a database) and enqueues the job in Redis.
3. **Worker process** picks up jobs from Redis, processes them, and sends emails via SMTP.
4. **Failure handling** is supported—failed email sends are retried or passed to a handler for fallback logic.
5. **Success path** completes with email successfully delivered.

├── queue.ts       # Redis queue producer logic
├── worker.ts      # Worker that consumes queue and sends email
├── email.ts       # Email sending (SMTP) utility
└── failure.ts     # Failure handler and retry logic
```

### TL;DR

RedisDistro offers a robust, TypeScript-based framework for processing email queues with **Redis and Express**—designed for speed, reliability, and separation between request handling and background email work.
